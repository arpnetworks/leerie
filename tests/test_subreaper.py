"""Tests for the orchestrator zombie-reaper (DESIGN §6 *Zombie reaping*).

The leerie container's PID 1 is `runuser`/the entrypoint (or an idle
`sleep infinity` on Fly), NOT a real init — it never `wait()`s arbitrary
orphans. Worker tool subtrees routinely orphan short-lived subprocesses
(git, ssh-agent, their children); without a subreaper those reparent to
PID 1 and rot as `<defunct>` zombies, each counting against the worker
cgroup's `pids.max` until it fills and every `fork()` EAGAINs. This was
captured live in production (453 defunct `git`, all ppid==1).

The fix: the orchestrator calls `_become_subreaper()` early in `main()`
(so orphaned descendants reparent to it) and runs `_zombie_reaper()` to
`waitpid` them. These tests verify both halves.
