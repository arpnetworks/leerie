"""Tests for the per-run staging-dir (`~/.cache/leerie/cfg-*`) cleanup.

Each `./leerie` run stages a copy of `~/.claude` (creds + small config) into a
fresh `mktemp -d …/cfg-XXXXXX` and removes it on exit via an EXIT trap. A
SIGKILL (OOM, `nerdctl kill`) or hard crash bypasses the trap and leaks the
dir; historically 500+ leaked, tens of GB. Two defenses, both pinned here:

1. A startup sweep removes `cfg-*` dirs older than a day (reclaims trap-bypass
   leaks).
2. The EXIT trap that removes `$STAGE` is registered IMMEDIATELY after the
   `mktemp`, so the ~250 lines of stage assembly below it (which include an
   `exit 1` on bad config) can't leak the dir.

The sweep test is behavioral (real fixture dirs); the trap test is
source-coupling (the trap's placement relative to `mktemp` is the invariant).
