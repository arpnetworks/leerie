"""Regression pins for the image's `ENV PATH=...` construction.

/home/leerie/.local/bin: `pip install --user` lands console scripts (e.g.
`pre-commit`) here. Without that dir on PATH they are unreachable whenever
a caller doesn't resolve them through an absolute path — the observed case
being a git hook whose embedded interpreter path points at a Python that
doesn't have the package installed.

Position is load-bearing, not incidental: the entry sits *after* $PATH so
image-baked tooling (the mise shims and the LTS Node bin that carry
`claude` itself — see the PATH comment in the Dockerfile) always wins
over anything a repo's setup step later `pip install --user`s. Moving it
ahead of $PATH would let a user-installed package silently shadow a baked-in
binary, which is why the ordering is pinned here rather than just membership.

/home/leerie/.local/share/mise/shims (`MISE_DATA_DIR/shims`): populated at
runtime by `mise install` reading a repo's .tool-versions / .ruby-version /
rust-toolchain.toml (DESIGN §6½ "Worker-driven install"). Without this dir
on PATH, a worker's own ad-hoc Bash commands (e.g. `bin/rails test`) fail
with `env: 'ruby': No such file or directory` on their first invocation
every single session, even though `phase_provision` already installed the
pinned runtime — the worker then has to rediscover `mise exec --` from
scratch. Position is load-bearing here too, in the opposite direction from
`.local/bin`: it sits *before* $PATH (so a repo's pinned runtime is actually
reachable) but *after* the system mise shims and the LTS Node bin, so a
repo pinning its own Node/Python version can never shadow the baked LTS
Node that hosts `claude` itself.

Source-coupling tests (mirroring tests/test_tmp_cache_writable.py and
tests/test_home_leerie_ownership.py): the real container behavior needs a
built image, which the plain pytest suite doesn't exercise.
